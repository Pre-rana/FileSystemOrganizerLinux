# LINUX FILE ORGANIZER
Managing large volumes of files on Linux can quickly become chaoticâ€”cluttered directories, lost files, and the tedious effort of manual sorting. The Linux File Organizer is a command-line utility designed to solve this problem efficiently. It scans a given directory, identifies files based on their extensions, and sorts them into categorized folders such as Documents, Images, Videos, Music, and Others.
Developed in C using system calls, this tool ensures no file is overwritten by handling duplicates intelligently.

## Features:
### 1. Automatic Sorting: 
Organizes files into predefined folders based on file extensions.

### 2. Duplicate Handling: 
Detects duplicate filenames and appends a unique identifier to avoid overwriting.

### 3. Fast & Lightweight: 
Built using C for minimal overhead and fast execution.

### 4. Modular Architecture: 
Easy to extend or customize categories and sorting logic.

### 5. Optimized for Linux: 
Uses system-level calls for robust performance in Unix-based systems.
